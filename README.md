# UFO Analysis
## Overview of Project:
Dana would like a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, she is wanting to add in filters for users. Those filters will be:
  - Date
  - City
  - State
  - Country
  - Shape
## Results
The way that a user can search through the website is by manipulating the filters in order to get the information that they would like to search. For example, the image provided below is a filter that the user can use in order to search for a specific date:

## Summary
One of the drawbacks from this website is that the country filter is not usuable, the recommendation I would have for this issue is to drop this filter and replace it with something that can be used. Another drawback from this site is the data from the comments are not well versed, I would recommend cleaning up the comments for a better understanding of the data for the user.
